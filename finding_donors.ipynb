    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    " **Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied: One of the real-world examples where Logistic Regression is applied is to identify whether a tumor is malign (cancerous) or not, based on a patient's physical conditions. We can base this prediction on the size and other features of the tumor.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? : First, Logistic Regression does not need a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Second, the independent and dependent variables need not be normally distributed. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- Logistic Regression performs well in binary classification, i.e., it works well when the output classes are linearly separable (can be separated by a single decision surface).\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? : Logistic Regression is not suitable for continuous outcome and unlike linear regression, logistic regression can only be used to predict discrete functions. Also, it requires quite large sample sizes.\n",
    "\tLogistic regression requires each data observation to be independent of each other. So in case the variables are highly correlated, this model won't perform well.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data? : In this problem, we are predicting whether a person's income is more than or at most 50k annually, which is a binary classification. Hence logistic regression is the simplest and the first obvious choice of algorithms.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied: SVM is applied to Bioinformatics, which includes protein classification and cancer classification. For example, it can be used for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? : One of the strengths of SVM includes that it is effective in high dimensional spaces. Also, it is versatile in a sense that we can use various kernel functions as the decision function.\n",
    "\tSVM performs well when the outcome is not separable by a single line. In that case, SVM can classify using a hyper-plane.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? : SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates. Overfitting may happen if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples. SVMs are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\tIf the feature dimension is very large, then SVM tends to perform poorly because of the computational complexity associated with the kernels with increasing dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data? : We know that this problem is about binary classification. And since Logistic regression gives not-so-good F score on this, it may be the case that SVM would be able to classify the data on some hyper plane.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "**Adaboost using Decision Tree:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied: An example where AdaBoost algorithm is used, is in the problem of Face Detection. Face detection is based on identifying and locating a human face in images regardless of size and position.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? : Adaboost has no parameters to tune (except for the number of rounds).  It can identify outliners: i.e. examples that are either mislabeled or that are inherently ambiguous and hard to categorize.\n",
    "          In case of Adaboost, instead of trying to design a learning algorithm that is accurate over the entire space, we can focus on finding base learning algorithms that only need to be better than random. Adaboost tends to perform well in classification problem.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? : AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "          The actual performance of boosting depends on the data and the base learner. When the number of outliners is very large, the emphasis placed on the hard examples can hurt the performance.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data? : In our case, Adaboost is a good choice first because ours is a binary classification problem and the data is not very noisy. Hence Adaboost should perform quite well in this case.\n",

    "The above performance metrics show that the **Adaboost** model (AdaBoostClassifier) is best suited at identifying individuals making more than \\$50k.\n",
    "When we look at the graph for F-score on testing set (100\\% test set), we can see that the F-score for Adaboost is around 0.73, which is more than that of Logistic Regression (0.68) or Support Vector Machine (0.67). We can also see that Adaboost is doing better on the testing set than training set, which tells us that the algorithm didnot overfit. So we can safely say that Adaboost will perform better on unknown data-sets more than the other two models. Also the prediction and training time for Adaboost is considerably low than SVM (by looking at the first set of graphs). Our problem is one of Binary classification and we know that the data, we have, is quite free of noise. Hence our selected algorithm, Adaboost, is suitable to our data as well."

    "The final model, chosen here, is **Adaboost**. This is known as an ensemble method. The idea behind it is to first build a model from the training data, and then a second model to correct the errors of the first model with higher priority (or weightage). This process of building models continues until all the training data are correctly predicted or until the maximum number of models have been added. Finally we average out the performances of all the models, that we had built, with their respective weightages. One interesting fact here is that we can select any algorithm as the model underneath the hood of Adaboost. What's even more interesting is that each chosen model might not be the best predictor of the training set. It only needs to be just better than guessing (which has a 50\\% chance of being correct). Together the models will give a resulting prediction way better than just a single model applied on the training data. Only thing we have to keep in mind is that the training data should not contain many noise or outliers. So we would need to clean up the data a bit before we can apply this model.\n",

    "- Similar to Capital gain, chosen by me, Capital loss should also contribute to a person's income, since more the loss is less will be the person's income. Another feature that I had missed is Education number. This also seems to be relevant since people with more number of education years are eligible for higher-qualified and higher-paid jobs than others. Hence this is an important feature for contributing towards a person's annual income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
